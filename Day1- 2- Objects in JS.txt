--Object is one of the important reference datatype of JavaScript.
--Object is Unordered collection of related data
--Object behave like a container, that holds different type of properties.
--It stores their element/properties in Key: Value Pairs.
--Each Key value pair is called as property
--key value pair is separated by using ":" (colon) symbol
--Object is more flexible when compared to array
--Object values are accessed by using the object name .(dot) followed by key name (objectName.key1)

syntax:

      datatype objectName {
            key 1:"Value 1",
            key 2:"Value 2",
            key 3:"Value 3",
            key 4:"Value 4"
      }

 Example:  


     var mobile ={
            model:"Apple",
            color:"Orange",
            body:"metal",
            batteryCapacity:"3,110 mAh"
     }     


-- In the above example, mobile is called as object objectName
-- whereas model,color,body,batteryCapacity are called as key's of the mobile object
--the value which is enclosed with "" are the values of the particular key
